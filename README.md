CS330-Computer-Graphics-and-Visualization

Final Project from my Computer Graphics course tasked with using OpenGL to recreate a 3D scene based on a 2D photograph.
This project gave me quite a bit of experience using C and learning how to not only create objects in 3D, but texture and add lighting to them. This process was worked in iteration, first with adding shapes, then creating complex shapes using basic shapes, positioning them, adjusting the camera with external devices such as mouse and keyboard, texuring the objects, and lighting the scene. This made the process much easier to manage as each step had a clear goal. In future work The organization could be applied. All learning provides some benefits, both in the educational and professional pathways. I am not sure how much I will utilize these skills, but having a baseline understanding is nothing but beneficial.
